# AquaticFunctionalTraits

Mental map associated to the article: Functional trait-based approaches as a common framework for freshwater and marine ecologists.

## Interactive mental map
In the file *Traits_Mental_map_ScholarLinks.html* you will find the interactive mental map of aquatic functional traits as described in the unified topology proposed in Martini et al. (2020). The R code is available in the *Traits_Mental_Map.R* file, and all text files that allowed to build it can be downloaded in the repository. A detailed description of the methods used for building this map is available in the *METHODS.md* file.

Hover your mouse over a node to highlight its connections. A simple click on a trait node will open a bibliography search about this trait in aquatic ecology studies. A maintained click on any node will allow you to move it around. Scroll to zoom in or out.

It is possible to add nodes and edges to the map by downloading and modifying the text files.

This map was constructed by Emile Faure using the igraph package in R:
Gábor Csárdi, Tamás Nepusz (2006) The igraph software package for complex network research. InterJournal Complex Systems, 1695.
The interactive representation of the map was allowed by the use of the NetworkD3 R package, developped by Christopher Gandrud, JJ Allaire, Kent Russell, & CJ Yetman (https://christophergandrud.github.io/networkD3/).
