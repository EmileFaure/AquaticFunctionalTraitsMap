# Methods for building the interactive mental map of aquatic functional traits

The typology of the map is directly derived from Figure 2 of Martini et al. (2020). 

Blue nodes correspond to ecological functions, which are column names in Figure 2, orange nodes correspond to trait types, which are row names in Figure 2, and grey nodes correspond to traits, which are cell values in Figure 2.

For each node of the mental map, we designed an hyperlink opening a google scholar search related to the corresponding trait/ecological function/trait type. Searches were designed using the same keywords as Figure 2 : ((functional trait OR trait-based) AND (aquatic OR 1950 marine OR ocean OR coastal OR deep-sea OR pelagic OR benthic OR fresh water OR lake 1951 OR river OR limnology)), to which we added specific keywords for each node. Keywords, nodes and vertex files could easily be modified to produce similar maps using the provided R code. 

**Please cite Martini et al. (2019) when using the map.**
